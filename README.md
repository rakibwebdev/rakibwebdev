- 👋 Hi, I’m Rakib Hossain from Bangladesh. I started my career as WordPress Support Engineer and then I got the promotion to the Web Developer Position. Being on the role of Support Engineer I provided client support of our WordPress theme and Plugin and solved PHP and JavaScript related bugs. After getting promotion I am working on WordPress theme development which our company sell on Themeforest. We are Power Elite Author on Themeforest. Recently, I am managing the Support team. I give the guide how would the provide support and If they get some major bug they report me and I solve them.
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Development. However, I am also interested on front end technologies like Javascript, React JS, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, Vue JS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wordpress plugin development and React JS. Learning React JS as it is now mostly used for plugin setting page development.
